Digital Signage Server - Quick Start Guide
===============================================

FIRST TIME SETUP (Required - Only Once):
==========================================

Windows requires URL ACL configuration to allow the
server to bind to HTTP ports without Administrator
privileges. This is a ONE-TIME setup.

Step 1: Run URL ACL Setup
--------------------------
1. Find the file "setup-urlacl.bat" in this folder
2. Right-click on it
3. Select "Run as administrator"
4. Press any key when prompted
5. Wait for "Setup Complete!" message
6. Close the window

That's it! You only need to do this ONCE.


DAILY USE (After Setup):
=========================

Just double-click: DigitalSignage.Server.exe

Or run from command line:
  dotnet run


TROUBLESHOOTING:
================

Problem: "Access Denied" error when starting
Solution: Run setup-urlacl.bat as admin (see above)

Problem: Port 8080 is already in use
Solution: Run fix-and-run.bat (will automatically
          stop conflicting processes and start server)

Problem: Build errors or other issues
Solution: Run diagnose-server.ps1 for detailed
          diagnostics and solutions


COMMON FILES:
=============

setup-urlacl.bat        - One-time URL ACL configuration (run as admin)
fix-and-run.bat         - Automatic fix and server start
diagnose-server.ps1     - Detailed diagnostics
appsettings.json        - Server configuration
logs/                   - Application logs


CHECKING IF URL ACL IS CONFIGURED:
===================================

Run in PowerShell:
  netsh http show urlacl | findstr ":8080"

If you see output, it's configured. If not, run
setup-urlacl.bat as administrator.


UNINSTALLING URL ACL:
=====================

If you want to remove the URL ACL configuration:

Run in PowerShell as Administrator:
  netsh http delete urlacl url=http://+:8080/ws/


ALTERNATIVE (NOT RECOMMENDED):
==============================

If you don't want to configure URL ACL, you can
run the server as Administrator every time:

1. Right-click DigitalSignage.Server.exe
2. Select "Run as administrator"

This is NOT recommended for security reasons.
The URL ACL setup is much better and safer.
